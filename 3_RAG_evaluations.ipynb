Only people trying to create new coins would need to run network nodes.  At first, most users would run network nodes, but as the network grows beyond a certain point, it would be left more and more to specialists with server farms of specialized hardware.  A server farm would only need to have one node on the network and the rest of the LAN connects with that one node.\\nThe bandwidth might not be as prohibitive as you think.  A typical transaction would be about 400 bytes (ECC is nicely compact).  Each transaction has to be broadcast twice, so lets say 1KB per transaction.  Visa processed 37 billion transactions in FY2008, or an average of 100 million transactions per day.  That many transactions would take 100GB of bandwidth, or the size of 12 DVD or 2 HD quality movies, or about $18 worth of bandwidth at current prices.\\nIf the network were to get that big, it would take several years, and by then, sending 2 HD movies over the Internet would probably not seem like a big deal.\\nSatoshi Nakamoto\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\\nThe Cryptography Mailing List\\nUnsubscribe by sending \"unsubscribe cryptography\" to majordomo at metzdowd.com\\nBitcoin P2P e-cash paper\\nCryptography Mailing List']\n",

This is because each time a new block is found, there is a 90% chance that the transaction will be included in it, assuming the transaction has reached 90% of nodes. Additionally, if multiple nodes have heard about the transaction, they will keep it in their working set until it gets into a block.\n",

The transaction in whichever branch ends up getting ahead becomes the valid one, the other is invalid.  If someone tries to double spend like that, one and only one spend will always become valid, the others invalid.\\nReceivers of transactions will normally need to hold transactions for perhaps an hour or more to allow time for this kind of possibility to be resolved.  They can still re-spend the coins immediately, but they should wait before taking an action such as shipping goods.\\n> I also don\\'t understand exactly how double-spending, or cancelling\\n> transactions, is accomplished by a superior attacker who is able to muster\\n> more computing power than all the honest participants.

More explanation of this\\n> attack would be helpful, in order to judge the gains to an attacker from\\n> this, versus simply using his computing power to mint new coins honestly.\\nThe attacker isn\\'t adding blocks to the end.  He has to go back and redo the block his transaction is in and all the blocks after it, as well as any new blocks the network keeps adding to the end while he\\'s doing that.  He\\'s rewriting history.  Once his branch is longer, it becomes the new valid one.\\nThis touches on a key point.  Even though everyone present may see the shenanigans going on, there\\'s no way to take advantage of that fact.\\nIt is strictly necessary that the longest chain is always considered the valid one.  Nodes that were present may remember that one branch was there first and got replaced by another, but there would be no way for them to convince those who were not present of this.  We can\\'t have subfactions of nodes that cling to one branch that they think was first, others that saw another branch first, and others that joined later and never saw what happened.  The CPU power proof-of-work vote must have the final say.  The only way for everyone to stay on the same page is to believe that the longest chain is always the valid one, no matter what.\\n> As far as the spending transactions, what checks does the recipient of a\\n> coin have to perform?

When a node receives a block, it checks the signatures of every transaction in it against previous transactions in blocks.  Blocks can only contain', ' transactions that depend on valid transactions in previous blocks or the same block.  Transaction C could depend on transaction B in the same block and B depends on transaction A in an earlier block.\\n> Sorry about all the questions, but as I said this does seem to be a\\n> very promising and original idea, and I am looking forward to seeing\\n> how the concept is further developed.

It's a memoryless process where you do millions of hashes a second, with a small chance of finding one each time.  The 3 or 4 fastest nodes' dominance would only be proportional to their share of the total CPU power.  Anyone's chance of finding a solution at any time is proportional to their CPU power.\\nThere will be transaction fees, so nodes will have an incentive to receive and include all the transactions they can.  Nodes will eventually be compensated by transaction fees alone when the total coins created hits the pre-determined ceiling.\\n> Also, the work requirement for adding a link to the chain should\", \"Source: https://satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org/posts/bitcointalk/405/\\nThat's right.Ã‚Â\\xa0 You don't need to be re-broadcasting your transactions for it to work.When any node disconnects a fork, it dumps all the transactions from the fork back into the transaction pool to add to the new chain.Ã‚Â\\xa0 The entire network is making sure to re-integrate your transactions again.Ã‚Â\\xa0 All you should see is that your number of confirmations starts over from 0.In some types of forks, your transaction would have gotten into both forks already, so you're already good either way.\\nRe: Hypothetical question on lost coins / transfers\\nAugust 19, 2010 at 20:28:50 UTC\\nBitcoinTalk\"]\n",
