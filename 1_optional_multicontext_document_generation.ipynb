Only people trying to create new coins would need to run network nodes.  At first, most users would run network nodes, but as the network grows beyond a certain point, it would be left more and more to specialists with server farms of specialized hardware.  A server farm would only need to have one node on the network and the rest of the LAN connects with that one node.\\nThe bandwidth might not be as prohibitive as you think.  A typical transaction would be about 400 bytes (ECC is nicely compact).  Each transaction has to be broadcast twice, so lets say 1KB per transaction.  Visa processed 37 billion transactions in FY2008, or an average of 100 million transactions per day.  That many transactions would take 100GB of bandwidth, or the size of 12 DVD or 2 HD quality movies, or about $18 worth of bandwidth at current prices.\\nIf the network were to get that big, it would take several years, and by then, sending 2 HD movies over the Internet would probably not seem like a big deal.\\nSatoshi Nakamoto\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\\nThe Cryptography Mailing List\\nUnsubscribe by sending \"unsubscribe cryptography\" to majordomo at metzdowd.com\\nBitcoin P2P e-cash paper\\nCryptography Mailing List'],\n",

It's\\ncompletely decentralized, with no central server or trusted parties,\\nbecause everything is based on crypto proof instead of trust.  Give it a\\ntry, or take a look at the screenshots and design paper:\\nDownload Bitcoin v0.1 at\\nhttp://www.bitcoin.org\\nThe root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that's\\nrequired to make it work.  The central bank must be trusted not to\\ndebase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of\\nbreaches of that trust.  Banks must be trusted to hold our money and\\ntransfer it electronically, but they lend it out in waves of credit\\nbubbles with barely a fraction in reserve.  We have to trust them with\\nour privacy, trust them not to let identity thieves drain our accounts.\\nTheir massive overhead costs make micropayments impossible.\\nA generation ago, multi-user time-sharing computer systems had a similar\\nproblem.  Before strong encryption, users had to rely on password\\nprotection to secure their files, placing trust in the system\\nadministrator to keep their information private.  Privacy could always\\nbe overridden by the admin based on his judgment call weighing the\\nprinciple of privacy against other concerns, or at the behest of his\\nsuperiors.  Then strong encryption became available to the masses, and\\ntrust was no longer required.  Data could be secured in a way that was\\nphysically impossible for others to access, no matter for what reason,\\nno matter how good the excuse, no matter what.\\nIt's time we had the same thing for money.  With e-currency based on\\ncryptographic proof, without the need to trust a third party middleman,\\nmoney can be secure and transactions effortless.\\nOne of the fundamental building blocks for such a system is digital\\nsignatures.  A digital coin contains the public key of its owner.  To\\ntransfer it, the owner signs the coin together with the public key of\\nthe next owner.  Anyone can check the signatures to verify the chain of\\nownership.  It works well to secure ownership, but leaves one big\\nproblem unsolved: double-spending.  Any owner could try to re-spend an\\nalready spent coin by signing it again to another owner.  The usual\\nsolution is for a trusted company with a central database to check for\\ndouble-spending, but that just gets back to the trust model.  In its\\ncentral position, the company can override the users, and the fees\\nneeded to support the company make micropayments impractical.\\nBitcoin's solution is to use a peer-to-peer network to check for\\ndouble-spending.  In a nutshell, the network works like a distributed\\ntimestamp server, stamping the first transaction to spend a coin.  It\\ntakes advantage of the nature of information being easy to spread but\\nhard to stifle.  For details on how it works, see the design paper at\\nhttp://www.bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf\\nThe result is a distributed system with no single point of failure.\\nUsers hold the crypto keys to their own money and transact directly with\\neach other, with the help of the P2P network to check for double-spending.\\nSatoshi Nakamoto\\nhttp://www.bitcoin.org\\n[p2p-research] Bitcoin open source implementation of P2P currency\\nP2P Research List\"],\n",

The smaller farms are then the \"honest nodes\".  (I need a better term than \"honest\")  The more smaller farms resort to generating bitcoins, the higher the bar gets to overpower the network, making larger farms also too small to overpower it so that they may as well generate bitcoins too.

Nodes will only accept the first one they see, refusing the second one to arrive, so the earlier transaction would have many more nodes working on incorporating it into the next proof-of-work.  In effect, each node votes for its viewpoint of which transaction it saw first by including it in its proof-of-work effort.\\nIf the transactions did come at exactly the same time and there was an even split, it\\'s a toss up based on which gets into a proof-of-work first, and that decides which is valid.\\nWhen a node finds a proof-of-work, the new block is propagated throughout the network and everyone adds it to the chain and starts working on the next block after it.  Any nodes that had the other transaction will stop trying to include it in a block, since it\\'s now invalid according to the accepted chain.\\nThe proof-of-work chain is itself self-evident proof that it came from the globally shared view.  Only the majority of the network together has enough CPU power to generate such a difficult chain of proof-of-work.  Any user, upon receiving the proof-of-work chain, can see what the majority of the network has approved.  Once a transaction is hashed into a link that\\'s a few links back in the chain, it is firmly etched into the global history.\\nSatoshi Nakamoto\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\\nThe Cryptography Mailing List\\nUnsubscribe by sending \"unsubscribe cryptography\" to majordomo at metzdowd.com\\nBitcoin P2P e-cash paper\\nCryptography Mailing List',\n",

I\\'ll try to rephrase it in that context.\\nA number of Byzantine Generals each have a computer and want to attack the King\\'s wi-fi by brute forcing the password, which they\\'ve learned is a certain number of characters in length.  Once they stimulate the network to generate a packet, they must crack the password within a limited time to break in and erase the logs, otherwise they will be discovered and get in trouble.  They only have enough CPU power to crack it fast enough if a majority of them attack at the same time.\\nThey don\\'t particularly care when the attack will be, just that they all agree.  It has been decided that anyone who feels like it will announce a time, and whatever time is heard first will be the official attack time.  The problem is that the network is not instantaneous, and if two generals announce different attack times at close to the same time, some may hear one first and others hear the other first.\\nThey use a proof-of-work chain to solve the problem.  Once each general receives whatever attack time he hears first, he sets his computer to solve an extremely difficult proof-of-work problem that includes the attack time in its hash.  The proof-of-work is so difficult, it\\'s expected to take 10 minutes of them all working at once before one of them finds a solution.  Once one of the generals finds a proof-of-work, he broadcasts it to the network, and everyone changes their current proof-of-work computation to include that proof-of-work in the hash they\\'re working on.  If anyone was working on a different attack time, they switch to this one, because its proof-of-work chain is now longer.\\nAfter two hours, one attack time should be hashed by a chain of 12 proofs-of-work.  Every general, just by verifying the difficulty of the proof-of-work chain, can estimate how much parallel CPU power per hour was expended on it and see that it must have required the majority of the computers to produce that much proof-of-work in the allotted time.  They had to all have seen it because the proof-of-work is proof that they worked on it.  If the CPU power exhibited by the proof-of-work chain is sufficient to crack the password, they can safely attack at the agreed time.\\nThe proof-of-work chain is how all the synchronisation, distributed database and global view problems you\\'ve asked about are solved.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\\nThe Cryptography Mailing List\\nUnsubscribe by sending \"unsubscribe cryptography\" to majordomo at metzdowd.com\\nBitcoin P2P e-cash paper\\nCryptography Mailing List',\n",

We merely adjudicate which one of the spends is valid.  Receivers of transactions must wait a few blocks to make sure that resolution has had time to complete.

The transaction in whichever branch ends up getting ahead becomes the valid one, the other is invalid.  If someone tries to double spend like that, one and only one spend will always become valid, the others invalid.\\nReceivers of transactions will normally need to hold transactions for perhaps an hour or more to allow time for this kind of possibility to be resolved.  They can still re-spend the coins immediately, but they should wait before taking an action such as shipping goods.\\n> I also don\\'t understand exactly how double-spending, or cancelling\\n> transactions, is accomplished by a superior attacker who is able to muster\\n> more computing power than all the honest participants.

He has to go back and redo the block his transaction is in and all the blocks after it, as well as any new blocks the network keeps adding to the end while he\\'s doing that.  He\\'s rewriting history.  Once his branch is longer, it becomes the new valid one.\\nThis touches on a key point.  Even though everyone present may see the shenanigans going on, there\\'s no way to take advantage of that fact.\\nIt is strictly necessary that the longest chain is always considered the valid one.  Nodes that were present may remember that one branch was there first and got replaced by another, but there would be no way for them to convince those who were not present of this.  We can\\'t have subfactions of nodes that cling to one branch that they think was first, others that saw another branch first, and others that joined later and never saw what happened.  The CPU power proof-of-work vote must have the final say.  The only way for everyone to stay on the same page is to believe that the longest chain is always the valid one, no matter what.\\n> As far as the spending transactions, what checks does the recipient of a\\n> coin have to perform?

All transactions before that can be discarded.\\n> Do the timestamp nodes check transactions, making sure that\\n> the previous transaction on a coin is in the chain, thereby enforcing\\n> the rule that all transactions in the chain represent valid coins?\\nRight, exactly.  When a node receives a block, it checks the signatures of every transaction in it against previous transactions in blocks.  Blocks can only contain transactions that depend on valid transactions in previous blocks or the same block.  Transaction C could depend on transaction B in the same block and B depends on transaction A in an earlier block.\\n> Sorry about all the questions, but as I said this does seem to be a\\n> very promising and original idea, and I am looking forward to seeing\\n> how the concept is further developed.

When a new block arrives for the best branch, ConnectBlock removes the block\\'s transactions from the pending-tx pool.  If a different branch becomes longer, it calls DisconnectBlock on the main branch down to the fork, returning the block transactions to the pending-tx pool, and calls ConnectBlock on the new branch, sopping back up any transactions that were in both branches.  It\\'s expected that reorgs like this would be rare and shallow.\\nWith this optimisation, candidate branches are not really any burden.

TCP transmissions are rarely ever dropped these days, and the broadcast protocol has a retry mechanism to get the data from other nodes after a while.  If broadcasts turn out to be slower in practice than expected, the target time between blocks may have to be increased to avoid wasting resources.  We want blocks to usually propagate in much less time than it takes to generate them, otherwise nodes would spend too much time working on obsolete blocks.\\nI\\'m planning to run an automated test with computers randomly sending payments to each other and randomly dropping packets.\\n> 3.

Instead of the supply changing to keep the value the same, the supply is predetermined and the value changes. As the number of users grows, the value per coin increases. It has the potential for a positive feedback loop; as users increase, the value goes up, which could attract more users to take advantage of the increasing value.\\nBitcoin open source implementation of P2P currency\\nFebruary 18, 2009 at 20:50:00 UTC\\nP2P Foundation\"],\n",

Right now you have the server (server TCP socket) send the handshake. My reasons for this are anonymity of course. It is far too easy for ISPs to portscan clients and detect they are running this program.That's a good idea. Â\\xa0The side accepting the connection just needs to withhold from sending anything until it receives a valid handshake. Â\\xa0Any portscan would only get a dead connection that doesn't volunteer to identify itself.Quote- Use some sort of encryption during the handshake (sort of goes with the statement/request above) to obfuscate what the software is during DPI (deep packet inspection). I am really thinking about people in non-free (as in freedom) countries such as China/Iran.I have thought about eventually SSLing all the connections. Â\\xa0I assume anything short of SSL would be pointless against DPI. Â\\xa0Maybe a better more immediate solution is to connect through TOR, which will be possible with 0.2.Quote- Some sort of an API is needed so that this system can be integrated with websites to provide instant-on services. A simple https receipt mechanism would do wonders. Have the client post each incoming payment to an https url with all of the relevant information and provide status updates. Also an outbound payment mechanism would be nice. So one could automate payments (and batch payments) outbound. Status could be returned via the https receipt interface.That's one of the main things on the agenda after 0.2.Quote- Static port/Random port. Have a setting to randomly assign the port that it runs on. (also be able to set it statically for very restrictive firewalls).Yeah, the other stealth stuff would be kinda pointless if it's always the same port number.Quote- UPnP support. Have the client automatically create the port forward on upstream routers. Enabled by default. Can be turned off in the options menu.I'm looking forward to trying UPnP. Â\\xa0Do most P2P clients typically have UPnP enabled by default?Quote- Ability to compile a headless (console only) install for *NIX systems. Also have the ability to just run as a network service. Perhaps with a telnet-able port for control (or even a unix socket would be ok).I'm still thinking about how best to structure the management interface.

Â\\xa0This is not implemented and I probably won\\'t have time to implement it soon, but just to let you know what\\'s possible.The basic escrow: The buyer commits a payment to escrow. The seller receives a transaction with the money in escrow, but he can\\'t spend it until the buyer unlocks it. The buyer can release the payment at any time after that, which could be never. This does not allow the buyer to take the money back, but it does give him the option to burn the money out of spite by never releasing it. The seller has the option to release the money back to the buyer.While this system does not guarantee the parties against loss, it takes the profit out of cheating.If the seller doesn\\'t send the goods, he doesn\\'t get paid. The buyer would still be out the money, but at least the seller has no monetary motivation to stiff him.The buyer can\\'t benefit by failing to pay. He can\\'t get the escrow money back. He can\\'t fail to pay due to lack of funds. The seller can see that the funds are committed to his key and can\\'t be sent to anyone else.Now, an economist would say that a fraudulent seller could start negotiating, such as \"release the money and I\\'ll give you half of it back\", but at that point, there would be so little trust and so much spite that negotiation is unlikely. Why on earth would the fraudster keep his word and send you half if he\\'s already breaking his word to steal it?

Â\\xa0Past transactions can become unconfirmed, go away and come back, become invalid and disappear, or be replaced by a different double-spend. Â\\xa0Their date can change, their order can change.Programmers are naturally inclined to want to use listtransactions like this: feed me the new transactions since I last asked, and I'll keep my own tally or static record of them. Â\\xa0This will seem to work in all regular use, but if you use the amounts for anything, it is highly exploitable:1) How do you know if a past transaction becomes invalid and disappears?2) When there's a block-chain reorg, it would be easy to double-count transactions when they get confirmed again.3) A transaction can be replaced by a double-spend with a different txid. Â\\xa0You would count both spends.The model where you assume you only need to see new transactions because you've already seen previous transactions is not true. Â\\xa0Old transactions can change at any time.Any time you take an action based on payment amounts received, you always need to go back to bitcoin and ask for a current balance total (or use move or sendfrom), and be ready for the possibility that it can go down.Now that we have the Accounts feature making it easier to do it the right way, we're better prepared to have listtransactions.\\nRe: JSON-RPC method idea: list transactions newer than a given txid\\nDecember 8, 2010 at 20:21:49 UTC\\nBitcoinTalk\"],\n",

Â\\xa0An analytical attack prescribes a certain range or pattern of inputs to try that will greatly increase your chance of finding a collision.

Â\\xa0You still have to get SHA-256 to output that value, so you would still have to break SHA-256 too.For brute force, RIPEMD-160(SHA-256(x)) is no stronger than RIPEMD-160 alone. Â\\xa0But for analytical attack, it seems like you must analytical attack both RIPEMD-160 and SHA-256.

Â\\xa0The payee does not really notice, because at the moment the new transaction becomes valid, the old one becomes invalid, and the new transaction simply takes its place.It's easier said than implemented. Â\\xa0There would be a fair amount of work to make a client that correctly writes the double-spend, manages the two versions in the wallet until one is chosen, handles all the corner cases. Â\\xa0Every assumption in the existing code is that you're not trying to write double-spends.There would need to be some changes on the Bitcoin Miner side also, to make the possibility to accept a double-spend into the transaction pool, but only strictly if the inputs and outputs match and the transaction fee is higher.
