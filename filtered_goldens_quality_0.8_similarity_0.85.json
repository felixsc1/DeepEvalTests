Only people trying to create new coins would need to run network nodes.  At first, most users would run network nodes, but as the network grows beyond a certain point, it would be left more and more to specialists with server farms of specialized hardware.  A server farm would only need to have one node on the network and the rest of the LAN connects with that one node.\nThe bandwidth might not be as prohibitive as you think.  A typical transaction would be about 400 bytes (ECC is nicely compact).  Each transaction has to be broadcast twice, so lets say 1KB per transaction.  Visa processed 37 billion transactions in FY2008, or an average of 100 million transactions per day.  That many transactions would take 100GB of bandwidth, or the size of 12 DVD or 2 HD quality movies, or about $18 worth of bandwidth at current prices.\nIf the network were to get that big, it would take several years, and by then, sending 2 HD movies over the Internet would probably not seem like a big deal.\nSatoshi Nakamoto\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe Cryptography Mailing List\nUnsubscribe by sending \"unsubscribe cryptography\" to majordomo at metzdowd.com\nBitcoin P2P e-cash paper\nCryptography Mailing List"

The requirement is that the good guys collectively have more CPU power than any single attacker.\nThere would be many smaller zombie farms that are not big enough to overpower the network, and they could still make money by generating bitcoins.  The smaller farms are then the \"honest nodes\".  (I need a better term than \"honest\")  The more smaller farms resort to generating bitcoins, the higher the bar gets to overpower the network, making larger farms also too small to overpower it so that they may as well generate bitcoins too.  According to the \"long tail\" theory, the small, medium and merely large farms put together should add up to a lot more than the biggest zombie farm.\nEven if a bad guy does overpower the network, it's not like he's instantly rich.  All he can accomplish is to take back money he himself spent, like bouncing a check.  To exploit it, he would have to buy something from a merchant, wait till it ships, then overpower the network and try to take his money back.  I don't think he could make as much money trying to pull a carding scheme like that as he could by generating bitcoins.  With a zombie farm that big, he could generate more bitcoins than everyone else combined.\nThe Bitcoin network might actually reduce spam by diverting zombie farms to generating bitcoins instead.\nSatoshi Nakamoto\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe Cryptography Mailing List\nUnsubscribe by sending \"unsubscribe cryptography\" to majordomo at metzdowd.com\nBitcoin P2P e-cash paper\nCryptography Mailing List"

The transaction in whichever branch ends up getting ahead becomes the valid one, the other is invalid.  If someone tries to double spend like that, one and only one spend will always become valid, the others invalid.\nReceivers of transactions will normally need to hold transactions for perhaps an hour or more to allow time for this kind of possibility to be resolved.  They can still re-spend the coins immediately, but they should wait before taking an action such as shipping goods.\n> I also don't understand exactly how double-spending, or cancelling\n> transactions, is accomplished by a superior attacker who is able to muster\n> more computing power than all the honest participants.

He has to go back and redo the block his transaction is in and all the blocks after it, as well as any new blocks the network keeps adding to the end while he's doing that.  He's rewriting history.  Once his branch is longer, it becomes the new valid one.\nThis touches on a key point.  Even though everyone present may see the shenanigans going on, there's no way to take advantage of that fact.\nIt is strictly necessary that the longest chain is always considered the valid one.  Nodes that were present may remember that one branch was there first and got replaced by another, but there would be no way for them to convince those who were not present of this.  We can't have subfactions of nodes that cling to one branch that they think was first, others that saw another branch first, and others that joined later and never saw what happened.  The CPU power proof-of-work vote must have the final say.  The only way for everyone to stay on the same page is to believe that the longest chain is always the valid one, no matter what.\n> As far as the spending transactions, what checks does the recipient of a\n> coin have to perform?

Nodes will only accept the first one they see, refusing the second one to arrive, so the earlier transaction would have many more nodes working on incorporating it into the next proof-of-work.  In effect, each node votes for its viewpoint of which transaction it saw first by including it in its proof-of-work effort.\nIf the transactions did come at exactly the same time and there was an even split, it's a toss up based on which gets into a proof-of-work first, and that decides which is valid.\nWhen a node finds a proof-of-work, the new block is propagated throughout the network and everyone adds it to the chain and starts working on the next block after it.  Any nodes that had the other transaction will stop trying to include it in a block, since it's now invalid according to the accepted chain.\nThe proof-of-work chain is itself self-evident proof that it came from the globally shared view.  Only the majority of the network together has enough CPU power to generate such a difficult chain of proof-of-work.  Any user, upon receiving the proof-of-work chain, can see what the majority of the network has approved.  Once a transaction is hashed into a link that's a few links back in the chain, it is firmly etched into the global history.\nSatoshi Nakamoto\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe Cryptography Mailing List\nUnsubscribe by sending \"unsubscribe cryptography\" to majordomo at metzdowd.com\nBitcoin P2P e-cash paper\nCryptography Mailing List"

All nodes receive them and keep both, but only work on the one they received first.  We'll suppose exactly half received one first, half the other.\nIn a short time, all the transactions will finish propagating so that everyone has the full set.  The nodes working on each side will be trying to add the transactions that are missing from their side.  When the next proof-of-work is found, whichever previous block that node was working on, that branch becomes longer and the tie is broken.  Whichever side it is, the new block will contain the other half of the transactions, so in either case, the branch will contain all transactions.  Even in the unlikely event that a split happened twice in a row, both sides of the second split would contain the full set of transactions anyway.\nIt's not a problem if transactions have to wait one or a few extra cycles to get into a block.\nSatoshi Nakamoto\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe Cryptography Mailing List\nUnsubscribe by sending \"unsubscribe cryptography\" to majordomo at metzdowd.com\nBitcoin P2P e-cash paper\nCryptography Mailing List"

It's as simple as this: let the output value from any transaction be 1 cent less than the input value.  Either the client software automatically writes transactions for 1 cent more than the intended payment value, or it could come out of the payee's side.  The incentive value when a node finds a proof-of-work for a block could be the total of the fees in the block.\nSatoshi Nakamoto\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe Cryptography Mailing List\nUnsubscribe by sending \"unsubscribe cryptography\" to majordomo at metzdowd.com\nBitcoin P2P e-cash paper\nCryptography Mailing List"

The target time between blocks will probably be 10 minutes.\nEvery block includes its creation time.  If the time is off by more than 36 hours, other nodes won't work on it.  If the timespan over the last 6*24*30 blocks is less than 15 days, blocks are being generated too fast and the proof-of-work difficulty doubles.  Everyone does the same calculation with the same chain data, so they all get the same result at the same link in the chain.\n> We want spenders to have certainty that their\n> transaction is valid at the time it takes a spend to\n> flood the network, not at the time it takes for branch\n> races to be resolved.\nInstantant non-repudiability is not a feature, but it's still much faster than existing systems.  Paper cheques can bounce up to a week or two later.  Credit card transactions can be contested up to 60 to 180 days later.  Bitcoin transactions can be sufficiently irreversible in an hour or two.\n> If one node is ignoring all spends that it does not\n> care about, it suffers no adverse consequences.\nWith the transaction fee based incentive system I recently posted, nodes would have an incentive to include all the paying transactions they receive.\nSatoshi Nakamoto\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe Cryptography Mailing List\nUnsubscribe by sending \"unsubscribe cryptography\" to majordomo at metzdowd.com\nBitcoin P2P e-cash paper\nCryptography Mailing List"

When a new block arrives for the best branch, ConnectBlock removes the block's transactions from the pending-tx pool.  If a different branch becomes longer, it calls DisconnectBlock on the main branch down to the fork, returning the block transactions to the pending-tx pool, and calls ConnectBlock on the new branch, sopping back up any transactions that were in both branches.  It's expected that reorgs like this would be rare and shallow.\nWith this optimisation, candidate branches are not really any burden.  They just sit on the disk and don't require attention unless they ever become the main chain.\n> Or as James raised earlier, if the network broadcast\n> is reliable but depends on a potentially slow flooding\n> algorithm, how does that impact performance?\nBroadcasts will probably be almost completely reliable.  TCP transmissions are rarely ever dropped these days, and the broadcast protocol has a retry mechanism to get the data from other nodes after a while.  If broadcasts turn out to be slower in practice than expected, the target time between blocks may have to be increased to avoid wasting resources.  We want blocks to usually propagate in much less time than it takes to generate them, otherwise nodes would spend too much time working on obsolete blocks.\nI'm planning to run an automated test with computers randomly sending payments to each other and randomly dropping packets.\n> 3.

It's\ncompletely decentralized, with no central server or trusted parties,\nbecause everything is based on crypto proof instead of trust.  Give it a\ntry, or take a look at the screenshots and design paper:\nDownload Bitcoin v0.1 at\nhttp://www.bitcoin.org\nThe root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that's\nrequired to make it work.  The central bank must be trusted not to\ndebase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of\nbreaches of that trust.  Banks must be trusted to hold our money and\ntransfer it electronically, but they lend it out in waves of credit\nbubbles with barely a fraction in reserve.  We have to trust them with\nour privacy, trust them not to let identity thieves drain our accounts.\nTheir massive overhead costs make micropayments impossible.\nA generation ago, multi-user time-sharing computer systems had a similar\nproblem.  Before strong encryption, users had to rely on password\nprotection to secure their files, placing trust in the system\nadministrator to keep their information private.  Privacy could always\nbe overridden by the admin based on his judgment call weighing the\nprinciple of privacy against other concerns, or at the behest of his\nsuperiors.  Then strong encryption became available to the masses, and\ntrust was no longer required.  Data could be secured in a way that was\nphysically impossible for others to access, no matter for what reason,\nno matter how good the excuse, no matter what.\nIt's time we had the same thing for money.  With e-currency based on\ncryptographic proof, without the need to trust a third party middleman,\nmoney can be secure and transactions effortless.\nOne of the fundamental building blocks for such a system is digital\nsignatures.  A digital coin contains the public key of its owner.  To\ntransfer it, the owner signs the coin together with the public key of\nthe next owner.  Anyone can check the signatures to verify the chain of\nownership.  It works well to secure ownership, but leaves one big\nproblem unsolved: double-spending.  Any owner could try to re-spend an\nalready spent coin by signing it again to another owner.  The usual\nsolution is for a trusted company with a central database to check for\ndouble-spending, but that just gets back to the trust model.  In its\ncentral position, the company can override the users, and the fees\nneeded to support the company make micropayments impractical.\nBitcoin's solution is to use a peer-to-peer network to check for\ndouble-spending.  In a nutshell, the network works like a distributed\ntimestamp server, stamping the first transaction to spend a coin.  It\ntakes advantage of the nature of information being easy to spread but\nhard to stifle.  For details on how it works, see the design paper at\nhttp://www.bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf\nThe result is a distributed system with no single point of failure.\nUsers hold the crypto keys to their own money and transact directly with\neach other, with the help of the P2P network to check for double-spending.\nSatoshi Nakamoto\nhttp://www.bitcoin.org\n[p2p-research] Bitcoin open source implementation of P2P currency\nP2P Research List"

Or maybe it has. There's only one transaction in the list but I'm up to 131 Blocks under \"Status\". Is this the way it's supposed to happen? Does it keep processing on the same transaction and generating coins every 120 blocks or so? Or is it supposed to start a new transaction?The number of blocks of a transaction is the amount of new blocks that have been generated by the whole network after the transaction. Each new block in the chain means new coins to its creator. One \"generated\" -transaction in your transaction list means that you have generated one block. You're not the first one to find the concept of a \"block\" a bit confusing on the first sight.Would it be clearer if the status said \"x confirmations\", like:2/unconfirmed3/unconfirmed4/unconfirmed5/unconfirmed6 confirmations7 confirmations8 confirmationsEach block essentially means another node has confirmed that it agrees with all transactions up to that point.\nRe: Is my second Transaction working correctly? +Transfer Question\nJanuary 5, 2010 at 20:00:46 UTC\nBitcoinTalk"

My browser will always be able to go to 127.0.0.1 (barring some strange IE settings or a virus). If I type the address into the URL bar or click a link, it will work fine. However, it isn't possible to use Javascript to complete POST requests between domains (or ports on the same domain).That's what I thought too.Quote from: sirius-m on June 16, 2010, 08:26:14 AMYeah, I meant to say that cross-domain javascript calls are forbidden, so you can't call 127.0.0.1 from a javascript that doesn't reside in 127.0.0.1. Come to think of it, it would be quite funny if browsers allowed malicious cross-domain javascript to change people's Facebook pages etc.Now I'm hearing a report that it IS possible for javascript to do a cross-domain POST request to 127.0.0.1.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Not other domains, but just specifically to that one.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Great...If this is the case, then do not use the -server switch or bitcoind on a system where you do web browsing.I'll get started on adding the password field.\nRe: URI-scheme for bitcoin\nJuly 18, 2010 at 16:06:16 UTC\nBitcoinTalk"

As I understand it, currency creation is fundamentally metered by TIME - and if that is the fundamental controlling variable, what is the need for everyone to \"roll as many dice as posible\" within that given time period? The \"chain of proof\" for coin ownership and transactions doesn't depend on the method for spawning coins.Each node's influence on the network is proportional to its CPU power. \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0The only way to show the network how much CPU power you have is to actually use it.If there's something else each person has a finite amount of that we could count for one-person-one-vote, I can't think of it. \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0IP addresses... much easier to get lots of them than CPUs.I suppose it might be possible to measure CPU powerat certain times. \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0For instance, if the CPU power challenge was only run for an average of 1 minute every 10 minutes. \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0You could still prove your total power at given times without running it all the time. \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0I'm not sure how that could be implemented though. \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0There's no way for a node that wasn't present at the time to know that a past chain was actually generated in a duty cycle with 9 minute breaks, not back to back.Proof-of-work has the nice property that it can be relayed through untrusted middlemen. \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0We don't have to worry about a chain of custody of communication. \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0It doesn't matter who tells you a longest chain, the proof-of-work speaks for itself.\nRe: Bitcoin minting is thermodynamically perverse\nAugust 7, 2010 at 17:46:09 UTC\nBitcoinTalk"

The seller receives a transaction with the money in escrow, but he can't spend it until the buyer unlocks it. The buyer can release the payment at any time after that, which could be never. This does not allow the buyer to take the money back, but it does give him the option to burn the money out of spite by never releasing it. The seller has the option to release the money back to the buyer.While this system does not guarantee the parties against loss, it takes the profit out of cheating.If the seller doesn't send the goods, he doesn't get paid. The buyer would still be out the money, but at least the seller has no monetary motivation to stiff him.The buyer can't benefit by failing to pay. He can't get the escrow money back. He can't fail to pay due to lack of funds. The seller can see that the funds are committed to his key and can't be sent to anyone else.Now, an economist would say that a fraudulent seller could start negotiating, such as \"release the money and I'll give you half of it back\", but at that point, there would be so little trust and so much spite that negotiation is unlikely. Why on earth would the fraudster keep his word and send you half if he's already breaking his word to steal it? I think for modest amounts, almost everyone would refuse on principle alone.\nEscrow\nAugust 7, 2010 at 20:13:52 UTC\nBitcoinTalk"

It allows one thread to execute x86 instructions while another can handle SSE2 instructions, effectively utilizing CPU resources better.

Users have reported similar hash rates with hyperthreading off compared to on, indicating that the benefits may depend on the nature of the tasks being performed.",

I think I get about the same amount of hashes when hyper threading is turned off with or without 4way.Hey, you may be onto something!hyperthreading didn't help before because all the work was in the arithmetic and logic units, which the hyperthreads share.tcatm's SSE2 code must be a mix of normal x86 instructions and SSE2 instructions, so while one is doing x86 code, the other can do SSE2.How much of an improvement do you get with hyperthreading?Some numbers? \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0What CPU is that?\nRe: tcatm's 4-way SSE2 for Linux 32/64-bit 0.3.9 rc2\nAugust 16, 2010 at 02:57:57 UTC\nBitcoinTalk"

It already is on block 74638.
