Only people trying to create new coins would need to run network nodes.  At first, most users would run network nodes, but as the network grows beyond a certain point, it would be left more and more to specialists with server farms of specialized hardware.  A server farm would only need to have one node on the network and the rest of the LAN connects with that one node.\nThe bandwidth might not be as prohibitive as you think.  A typical transaction would be about 400 bytes (ECC is nicely compact).  Each transaction has to be broadcast twice, so lets say 1KB per transaction.  Visa processed 37 billion transactions in FY2008, or an average of 100 million transactions per day.  That many transactions would take 100GB of bandwidth, or the size of 12 DVD or 2 HD quality movies, or about $18 worth of bandwidth at current prices.\nIf the network were to get that big, it would take several years, and by then, sending 2 HD movies over the Internet would probably not seem like a big deal.\nSatoshi Nakamoto\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe Cryptography Mailing List\nUnsubscribe by sending \"unsubscribe cryptography\" to majordomo at metzdowd.com\nBitcoin P2P e-cash paper\nCryptography Mailing List"

Open source C++ code is included.\n- Unpack the files into a directory\n- Run BITCOIN.EXE\n- It automatically connects to other nodes\nIf you can keep a node running that accepts incoming connections,\nyou'll really be helping the network a lot.  Port 8333 on your\nfirewall needs to be open to receive incoming connections.\nThe software is still alpha and experimental.  There's no guarantee\nthe system's state won't have to be restarted at some point if it\nbecomes necessary, although I've done everything I can to build in\nextensibility and versioning.\nYou can get coins by getting someone to send you some, or turn on\nOptions->Generate Coins to run a node and generate blocks.  I made\nthe proof-of-work difficulty ridiculously easy to start with, so\nfor a little while in the beginning a typical PC will be able to\ngenerate coins in just a few hours.  It'll get a lot harder when\ncompetition makes the automatic adjustment drive up the difficulty.\nGenerated coins must wait 120 blocks to mature before they can be\nspent.\nThere are two ways to send money.  If the recipient is online, you\ncan enter their IP address and it will connect, get a new public\nkey and send the transaction with comments.  If the recipient is\nnot online, it is possible to send to their Bitcoin address, which\nis a hash of their public key that they give you.  They'll receive\nthe transaction the next time they connect and get the block it's\nin.  This method has the disadvantage that no comment information\nis sent, and a bit of privacy may be lost if the address is used\nmultiple times, but it is a useful alternative if both users can't\nbe online at the same time or the recipient can't receive incoming\nconnections.\nTotal circulation will be 21,000,000 coins.

It's\ncompletely decentralized, with no central server or trusted parties,\nbecause everything is based on crypto proof instead of trust.  Give it a\ntry, or take a look at the screenshots and design paper:\nDownload Bitcoin v0.1 at\nhttp://www.bitcoin.org\nThe root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that's\nrequired to make it work.  The central bank must be trusted not to\ndebase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of\nbreaches of that trust.  Banks must be trusted to hold our money and\ntransfer it electronically, but they lend it out in waves of credit\nbubbles with barely a fraction in reserve.  We have to trust them with\nour privacy, trust them not to let identity thieves drain our accounts.\nTheir massive overhead costs make micropayments impossible.\nA generation ago, multi-user time-sharing computer systems had a similar\nproblem.  Before strong encryption, users had to rely on password\nprotection to secure their files, placing trust in the system\nadministrator to keep their information private.  Privacy could always\nbe overridden by the admin based on his judgment call weighing the\nprinciple of privacy against other concerns, or at the behest of his\nsuperiors.  Then strong encryption became available to the masses, and\ntrust was no longer required.  Data could be secured in a way that was\nphysically impossible for others to access, no matter for what reason,\nno matter how good the excuse, no matter what.\nIt's time we had the same thing for money.  With e-currency based on\ncryptographic proof, without the need to trust a third party middleman,\nmoney can be secure and transactions effortless.\nOne of the fundamental building blocks for such a system is digital\nsignatures.  A digital coin contains the public key of its owner.  To\ntransfer it, the owner signs the coin together with the public key of\nthe next owner.  Anyone can check the signatures to verify the chain of\nownership.  It works well to secure ownership, but leaves one big\nproblem unsolved: double-spending.  Any owner could try to re-spend an\nalready spent coin by signing it again to another owner.  The usual\nsolution is for a trusted company with a central database to check for\ndouble-spending, but that just gets back to the trust model.  In its\ncentral position, the company can override the users, and the fees\nneeded to support the company make micropayments impractical.\nBitcoin's solution is to use a peer-to-peer network to check for\ndouble-spending.  In a nutshell, the network works like a distributed\ntimestamp server, stamping the first transaction to spend a coin.  It\ntakes advantage of the nature of information being easy to spread but\nhard to stifle.  For details on how it works, see the design paper at\nhttp://www.bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf\nThe result is a distributed system with no single point of failure.\nUsers hold the crypto keys to their own money and transact directly with\neach other, with the help of the P2P network to check for double-spending.\nSatoshi Nakamoto\nhttp://www.bitcoin.org\n[p2p-research] Bitcoin open source implementation of P2P currency\nP2P Research List"

They'd essentially be reverse-spamming the spammers with\nautomated mailboxes that collect their POW and don't read the\nmessage.  The ratio of fake mailboxes to real people could become\ntoo high for spam to be cost effective.\nThe process has the potential to establish the POW token's value\nin the first place, since spammers that don't have a botnet could\nbuy tokens from harvesters.  While the buying back would\ntemporarily let more spam through, it would only hasten the\nself-defeating cycle leading to too many harvesters exploiting the\nspammers.\nInterestingly, one of the e-gold systems already has a form of\nspam called \"dusting\".

The requirement is that the good guys collectively have more CPU power than any single attacker.\nThere would be many smaller zombie farms that are not big enough to overpower the network, and they could still make money by generating bitcoins.  The smaller farms are then the \"honest nodes\".  (I need a better term than \"honest\")  The more smaller farms resort to generating bitcoins, the higher the bar gets to overpower the network, making larger farms also too small to overpower it so that they may as well generate bitcoins too.  According to the \"long tail\" theory, the small, medium and merely large farms put together should add up to a lot more than the biggest zombie farm.\nEven if a bad guy does overpower the network, it's not like he's instantly rich.  All he can accomplish is to take back money he himself spent, like bouncing a check.  To exploit it, he would have to buy something from a merchant, wait till it ships, then overpower the network and try to take his money back.  I don't think he could make as much money trying to pull a carding scheme like that as he could by generating bitcoins.  With a zombie farm that big, he could generate more bitcoins than everyone else combined.\nThe Bitcoin network might actually reduce spam by diverting zombie farms to generating bitcoins instead.\nSatoshi Nakamoto\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe Cryptography Mailing List\nUnsubscribe by sending \"unsubscribe cryptography\" to majordomo at metzdowd.com\nBitcoin P2P e-cash paper\nCryptography Mailing List"

That would have required a trusted party to determine the value, because I don't know a way for software to know the real world value of things. If there was some clever way, or if we wanted to trust someone to actively manage the money supply to peg it to something, the rules could have been programmed for that.In this sense, it's more typical of a precious metal. Instead of the supply changing to keep the value the same, the supply is predetermined and the value changes. As the number of users grows, the value per coin increases. It has the potential for a positive feedback loop; as users increase, the value goes up, which could attract more users to take advantage of the increasing value.\nBitcoin open source implementation of P2P currency\nFebruary 18, 2009 at 20:50:00 UTC\nP2P Foundation"

    "expected_output": "The proof-of-work chain in Bitcoin is used to solve the synchronization problem and establish a globally shared view of transactions without requiring trust in any single entity. It allows nodes to determine which transactions are valid by incorporating them into a chain that reflects the majority consensus of the network. When a node finds a proof-of-work, it propagates the new block, and all nodes update their chains accordingly, ensuring that only the longest valid chain is accepted. This mechanism also helps prevent double spending by adjudicating which transaction is valid based on the chain's history.",

Nodes will only accept the first one they see, refusing the second one to arrive, so the earlier transaction would have many more nodes working on incorporating it into the next proof-of-work.  In effect, each node votes for its viewpoint of which transaction it saw first by including it in its proof-of-work effort.\nIf the transactions did come at exactly the same time and there was an even split, it's a toss up based on which gets into a proof-of-work first, and that decides which is valid.\nWhen a node finds a proof-of-work, the new block is propagated throughout the network and everyone adds it to the chain and starts working on the next block after it.  Any nodes that had the other transaction will stop trying to include it in a block, since it's now invalid according to the accepted chain.\nThe proof-of-work chain is itself self-evident proof that it came from the globally shared view.  Only the majority of the network together has enough CPU power to generate such a difficult chain of proof-of-work.  Any user, upon receiving the proof-of-work chain, can see what the majority of the network has approved.  Once a transaction is hashed into a link that's a few links back in the chain, it is firmly etched into the global history.\nSatoshi Nakamoto\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe Cryptography Mailing List\nUnsubscribe by sending \"unsubscribe cryptography\" to majordomo at metzdowd.com\nBitcoin P2P e-cash paper\nCryptography Mailing List",

I'll try to rephrase it in that context.\nA number of Byzantine Generals each have a computer and want to attack the King's wi-fi by brute forcing the password, which they've learned is a certain number of characters in length.  Once they stimulate the network to generate a packet, they must crack the password within a limited time to break in and erase the logs, otherwise they will be discovered and get in trouble.  They only have enough CPU power to crack it fast enough if a majority of them attack at the same time.\nThey don't particularly care when the attack will be, just that they all agree.  It has been decided that anyone who feels like it will announce a time, and whatever time is heard first will be the official attack time.  The problem is that the network is not instantaneous, and if two generals announce different attack times at close to the same time, some may hear one first and others hear the other first.\nThey use a proof-of-work chain to solve the problem.  Once each general receives whatever attack time he hears first, he sets his computer to solve an extremely difficult proof-of-work problem that includes the attack time in its hash.  The proof-of-work is so difficult, it's expected to take 10 minutes of them all working at once before one of them finds a solution.  Once one of the generals finds a proof-of-work, he broadcasts it to the network, and everyone changes their current proof-of-work computation to include that proof-of-work in the hash they're working on.  If anyone was working on a different attack time, they switch to this one, because its proof-of-work chain is now longer.\nAfter two hours, one attack time should be hashed by a chain of 12 proofs-of-work.  Every general, just by verifying the difficulty of the proof-of-work chain, can estimate how much parallel CPU power per hour was expended on it and see that it must have required the majority of the computers to produce that much proof-of-work in the allotted time.  They had to all have seen it because the proof-of-work is proof that they worked on it.  If the CPU power exhibited by the proof-of-work chain is sufficient to crack the password, they can safely attack at the agreed time.\nThe proof-of-work chain is how all the synchronisation, distributed database and global view problems you've asked about are solved.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe Cryptography Mailing List\nUnsubscribe by sending \"unsubscribe cryptography\" to majordomo at metzdowd.com\nBitcoin P2P e-cash paper\nCryptography Mailing List",

If the same chain contains both spends, then the block is invalid and rejected.\nSame if a block didn't have enough proof-of-work.  That block is invalid and rejected.  There's no need to circulate a report about it.  Every node could see that and reject it before relaying it.\nIf there are two competing chains, each containing a different version of the same transaction, with one trying to give money to one person and the other trying to give the same money to someone else, resolving which of the spends is valid is what the whole proof-of-work chain is about.\nWe're not \"on the lookout\" for double spends to sound the alarm and catch the cheater.  We merely adjudicate which one of the spends is valid.  Receivers of transactions must wait a few blocks to make sure that resolution has had time to complete.  Would be cheaters can try and simultaneously double-spend all they want, and all they accomplish is that within a few blocks, one of the spends becomes valid and the others become invalid.  Any later double-spends are immediately rejected once there's already a spend in the main chain.\nEven if an earlier spend wasn't in the chain yet, if it was already in all the nodes' pools, then the second spend would be turned away by all those nodes that already have the first spend.\n> If the new chain is accepted, then they give up on adding their\n> current link, dump all the transactions from pool L back into pool\n> A (along with transactions they've received or created since\n> starting work), eliminate from pool A those transaction records\n> which are already part of a link in the new chain, and start work\n> again trying to extend the new chain.\nRight.

It's a memoryless process where you do millions of hashes a second, with a small chance of finding one each time.  The 3 or 4 fastest nodes' dominance would only be proportional to their share of the total CPU power.  Anyone's chance of finding a solution at any time is proportional to their CPU power.\nThere will be transaction fees, so nodes will have an incentive to receive and include all the transactions they can.

The transaction in whichever branch ends up getting ahead becomes the valid one, the other is invalid.  If someone tries to double spend like that, one and only one spend will always become valid, the others invalid.\nReceivers of transactions will normally need to hold transactions for perhaps an hour or more to allow time for this kind of possibility to be resolved.  They can still re-spend the coins immediately, but they should wait before taking an action such as shipping goods.\n> I also don't understand exactly how double-spending, or cancelling\n> transactions, is accomplished by a superior attacker who is able to muster\n> more computing power than all the honest participants.

He has to go back and redo the block his transaction is in and all the blocks after it, as well as any new blocks the network keeps adding to the end while he's doing that.  He's rewriting history.  Once his branch is longer, it becomes the new valid one.\nThis touches on a key point.  Even though everyone present may see the shenanigans going on, there's no way to take advantage of that fact.\nIt is strictly necessary that the longest chain is always considered the valid one.  Nodes that were present may remember that one branch was there first and got replaced by another, but there would be no way for them to convince those who were not present of this.  We can't have subfactions of nodes that cling to one branch that they think was first, others that saw another branch first, and others that joined later and never saw what happened.  The CPU power proof-of-work vote must have the final say.  The only way for everyone to stay on the same page is to believe that the longest chain is always the valid one, no matter what.\n> As far as the spending transactions, what checks does the recipient of a\n> coin have to perform?

All transactions before that can be discarded.\n> Do the timestamp nodes check transactions, making sure that\n> the previous transaction on a coin is in the chain, thereby enforcing\n> the rule that all transactions in the chain represent valid coins?\nRight, exactly.  When a node receives a block, it checks the signatures of every transaction in it against previous transactions in blocks.  Blocks can only contain transactions that depend on valid transactions in previous blocks or the same block.  Transaction C could depend on transaction B in the same block and B depends on transaction A in an earlier block.\n> Sorry about all the questions, but as I said this does seem to be a\n> very promising and original idea, and I am looking forward to seeing\n> how the concept is further developed.

While SHA-1 has been shown to have vulnerabilities, with collisions found in 2^52 operations, SHA256 remains robust against current computational capabilities and is not expected to be broken by Moore's law improvements.

As I understand it, currency creation is fundamentally metered by TIME - and if that is the fundamental controlling variable, what is the need for everyone to \"roll as many dice as posible\" within that given time period? The \"chain of proof\" for coin ownership and transactions doesn't depend on the method for spawning coins.Each node's influence on the network is proportional to its CPU power. \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0The only way to show the network how much CPU power you have is to actually use it.If there's something else each person has a finite amount of that we could count for one-person-one-vote, I can't think of it. \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0IP addresses... much easier to get lots of them than CPUs.I suppose it might be possible to measure CPU powerat certain times. \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0For instance, if the CPU power challenge was only run for an average of 1 minute every 10 minutes. \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0You could still prove your total power at given times without running it all the time. \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0I'm not sure how that could be implemented though. \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0There's no way for a node that wasn't present at the time to know that a past chain was actually generated in a duty cycle with 9 minute breaks, not back to back.Proof-of-work has the nice property that it can be relayed through untrusted middlemen. \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0We don't have to worry about a chain of custody of communication. \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0It doesn't matter who tells you a longest chain, the proof-of-work speaks for itself.\nRe: Bitcoin minting is thermodynamically perverse\nAugust 7, 2010 at 17:46:09 UTC\nBitcoinTalk"

The necessity to announce all transactions publicly precludes this method, but privacy can still be maintained by breaking the flow of information in another place: by keeping public keys anonymous. The public can see that someone is sending an amount to someone else, but without information linking the transaction to anyone. This is similar to the level of information released by stock exchanges, where the time and size of individual trades, the \"tape\", is made public, but without telling who the parties were.\nOctober 31, 2008"

      "Source: https://satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org/quotes/transactions/\nTransactions\nWe need a way for the payee to know that the previous owners did not sign any earlier transactions. For our purposes, the earliest transaction is the one that counts, so we don't care about later attempts to double-spend. The only way to confirm the absence of a transaction is to be aware of all transactions. In the mint based model, the mint was aware of all transactions and decided which arrived first. To accomplish this without a trusted party, transactions must be publicly announced, and we need a system for participants to agree on a single history of the order in which they were received. The payee needs proof that at the time of each transaction, the majority of nodes agreed it was the first received.\nOctober 31, 2008"
